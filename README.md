# Hacknight Format
As this is our first time attempting this, the format is loose for the time being and very much open to ideas and suggestions.

You can either:

- Submit your project or an project that you would like to work a head of time to the GLUG Github repo as an issue
- Or, simply show up with your suggested project or idea

Then we select a handful of submissions for the night, and give the submitters a brief period of time to present their suggested project.

We then break into groups and get hacking!
